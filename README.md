## prerequisites

I do expect that you have nodejs and ts installed already and there should be no problems with them

installed nodejs - https://nodejs.org/en current LTS is v20.17.0, but 18 will do as well

installed TypeScript - dependency one should be enouth, but to install globally you can use `npm install -g typescript` but in any case here is the link with instructions https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/

## setup project

`npm install` - install all dependencies

## run tests

run the tests with `npx wdio run ./wdio.conf.js` - this command will start the browser and you will see all interactions
